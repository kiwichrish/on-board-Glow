# on-board-Glow
Simple on-board low-side glow driver for R/C models using IRLZ44N and ATTiny-85

The source code was compiled / uploaded to the ATTiny-85 using the Arduino IDE and an Arduino Uno as ISCP.  It's not fancy at all, in fact completely the opposite but is might be a working base for something more sophisticated. :-)

The PCB schematic was done in KICAD.  I've included a .jpg and the .sch file.  At time of upload I've not done a PCB but if I need another one I'll do a PCB and update this reposititory as appropriate.
